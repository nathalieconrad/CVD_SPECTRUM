Clinical codes used to define cardiovascular diseases

For each condition, a list of diagnostic codes from was compiled to identify diagnoses based on the coding schemes in use in each data source. Code lists for event identification will be established following previously established methods (see https://github.com/nathalieconrad/CVD_incidence)
and include diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10)) and procedures (UK Office of Population Census and Surveys classification (OPCS-4)).

These code lists are presented in the attached file "2025-06-06_CVD_diagnostic_codes_table_ICD10_OPCS4_for_appendix.txt" on our GitHub repository 
(see https://github.com/nathalieconrad/CVD_risk_factors). Â
